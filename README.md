Adamâ€™s Pizzeria API

A playful FastAPI service that walks a user through ordering a custom pizza at Adamâ€™s Pizzeria.  The API demonstrates basic REST endpoints, FastAPI routing, and simple request/response logic that can be expanded into a fullâ€‘stack application.

ðŸ“œ Introduction

This project is a toy example meant for beginners learning FastAPI.  It exposes readable, selfâ€‘documenting endpoints (thanks to Swagger UI) so you can explore HTTP interactions without writing any frontâ€‘end code.

All responses are simple strings so you can focus on request flow rather than payload structure.
